## Why Freddy?

Parsing JSON elegantly and safely can be hard, but Freddy is here to help. Freddy is a reusable framework for parsing JSON in Swift. It has three principal benefits.

First, Freddy provides a type safe solution to parsing JSON in Swift. This means that the compiler helps you work with sending and receiving JSON in a way that helps to prevent runtime crashes.

Second, Freddy provides an idiomatic solution to JSON parsing that takes advantage of Swift's generics, enumerations, and functional features. This is all provided without the pain of having to memorize our documentation to understand our magical custom operators. Freddy does not have any of those. If you feel comfortable writing Swift (using extensions, protocols, initializers, etc.), then you will not only understand how Freddy is organized, but you will also feel comfortable using Freddy.

Third, Freddy provides great error information for mistakes that commonly occur while parsing JSON.  If you subscript the JSON object with a key that is not present, you get an informative error.  If your desired index is out of bounds, you get an informative error.  If you try to convert a JSON value to the wrong type, you get a good error here too.

So, Freddy vs. JSON, who wins?  We think it is Freddy.

## Usage

This section describes Freddy's basic usage. You can find more examples on parsing data, dealing with errors, serializing `JSON` instances into `NSData`, and more in the [Wiki](https://github.com/bignerdranch/Freddy/wiki). You can read the [documentation to see the full API](http://bignerdranch.github.io/Freddy/index.html).

### Deserialization: Parsing Raw Data
#### Basic Usage
Consider some example JSON data:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "people": [
        {
            "name": "Matt Mathias",
            "age": 32,
            "spouse": true
        },
        {
            "name": "Sergeant Pepper",
            "age": 25,
            "spouse": false
        }
    ],
    "jobs": [
        "teacher",
        "judge"
    ],
    "states": {
        "Georgia": [
            30301,
            30302,
            30303
        ],
        "Wisconsin": [
            53000,
            53001
        ]
    }
}
```
Here is a quick example on how to parse this data using Freddy:

```swift
let data = getSomeData()
do {
    let json = try JSON(data: data)
    let success = try json.bool("success")
    // do something with `success`
} catch {
    // do something with the error
}
```

After we load in the data, we create an instance of `JSON`, the workhorse of this framework. This allows us to access the values from the JSON data. We `try` because the `data` may be malformed and the parsing could generate an error. Next, we access the `"success"` key by calling the `bool(_:)` method on `JSON`. We `try` here as well because accessing the `json` for the key `"success"` could fail - e.g., if we had passed an unknown key. This method takes two parameters, both of which are used to define a path into the `JSON` instance to find a Boolean value of interest. If a `Bool` is found at the path described by `"success"`, then `bool(_:)` returns a `Bool`. If the path does not lead to a `Bool`, then an appropriate error is thrown.

#### Use Paths to Access Nested Data with Subscripting
With Freddy, it is possible to use a path to access elements deeper in the json structure. For example:

```swift
let data = getSomeData()
do {
    let json = try JSON(data: data)
    let georgiaZipCodes = try json.array("states","Georgia")
    let firstPersonName = try json.string("people",0,"name")
} catch {
    // do something with the error
}
```

In the code `json.array("states","Georgia")`, the keys `"states"` and `"Georgia"` describe a path to the Georgia zip codes within `json`.
`Freddy`'s parlance calls this process "subscripting" the JSON.
What is typed between the parentheses of, for example, `array(_:)` is a comma-separated list of keys and indices that describe the path to a value of interest.

There can be any number of subscripts, and each subscript can be either a `String` indicating a named element in the JSON, or an `Int` that represents an element in an array. If there is something invalid in the path such as an index that doesn't exist in the JSON, an error will be thrown.

[More on Subscripting](https://github.com/bignerdranch/Freddy/wiki/Subscripting)

#### JSONDecodable: Deserializing Models Directly
Now, let's look an example that parses the data into a model class:

```swift
let data = getSomeData()
do {
    let json = try JSON(data: data)
    let people = try json.array("people").map(Person.init)
    // do something with `people`
} catch {
    // do something with the error
}
```

Here, we are instead loading the values from the key `"people"` as an array using the method `array(_:)`. This method works a lot like the `bool(_:)` method you saw above. It uses the path provided to the method to find an array. If the path is good, the method will return an `Array` of `JSON`. If the path is bad, then an appropriate error is thrown.

We can then call `map` on that `JSON` array. Since the `Person` type conforms to `JSONDecodable`, we can pass in the `Person` type's initializer. This call applies an initializer that takes an instance of `JSON` to each element in the array, producing an array of `Person` instances.

Here is what `JSONDecodable` looks like:

```swift
public protocol JSONDecodable {
    init(json: JSON) throws
}
```

It is fairly simple protocol.  All it requires is that conforming types implement an initializer that takes an instance of `JSON` as its sole parameter.

To tie it all together, here is what the `Person` type looks like:

```swift
public struct Person {
    public let name: String
    public let age: Int
    public let spouse: Bool
}

extension Person: JSONDecodable {
    public init(json value: JSON) throws {
        name = try value.string("name")
        age = try value.int("age")
        spouse = try value.bool("spouse")
    }
}
```

`Person` just has a few properties. It conforms to `JSONDecodable` via an extension. In the extension, we implement a `throws`ing initializer that takes an instance of `JSON` as its sole parameter. In the implementation, we `try` three functions: 1) `string(_:)`, 2) `int(_:)`, and 3) `bool(_:)`. Each of these works as you have seen before. The methods take in a path, which is used to find a value of a specific type within the `JSON` instance passed to the initializer. Since these paths could be bad, or the requested type may not match what is actually inside of the `JSON`, these methods may potentially throw an error.


### Serialization
Freddy's serialization support centers around the `JSON.serialize()` method.

#### Basic Usage
The `JSON` enumeration supports conversion to `NSData` directly:

```swift
let someJSON: JSON = …
let data: NSData = try someJSON.serialize()
```

#### JSONEncodable: Serializing Other Objects
Most of your objects aren't `Freddy.JSON` objects, though.
You can serialize them to `NSData` by first converting them to a
`Freddy.JSON` via `JSONEncodable.toJSON()`, the sole method of the
`JSONEncodable` protocol, and then using `serialize()` to convert
the `Freddy.JSON` to `NSData`:

```swift
let myObject: JSONEncodable = …

// Object -> JSON -> NSData:
let objectAsJSON: JSON = myObject.toJSON()
let data: NSData = try objectAsJSON.serialize()

// More concisely:
let dataOneLiner = try object.toJSON().serialize()
```

Freddy provides definitions for common Swift datatypes already.
To make your own datatypes serializable, conform them to `JSONEncodable`
and implement that protocol's `toJSON()` method:

```swift
extension Person: JSONEncodable {
    public func toJSON() -> JSON {
        return .Dictionary([
            "name": .String(name),
            "age": .Int(age),
            "spouse": .Bool(spouse)])
    }
}
```



## Getting Started

Freddy requires iOS 7.0, Mac OS X 10.9, watchOS 2.0, or tvOS 9.0. Linux is not yet supported.

Dynamic frameworks on iOS require a minimum deployment target of iOS 8.0. For a project targeting iOS 7, see ["Submodules"](https://github.com/bignerdranch/Freddy#submodules).

You have a few different options to install Freddy.

### [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

Add us to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "bignerdranch/Freddy" ~> 2.1
```

After running `carthage bootstrap`, add `Freddy.framework` to the "Linked Frameworks and Libraries" panel of your application target. [Read more](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application).

### [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)

Add us to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'Freddy'
```

Then run `pod install`.

### Submodules

1. `git submodule add https://github.com/bignerdranch/Freddy.git Vendor/Freddy`
2. Drag `Freddy.xcodeproj` into your Xcode project.
3. Add `Freddy.framework` to the "Linked Frameworks and Libraries" panel of your application target.

[Carthage](https://github.com/bignerdranch/Freddy#carthage) can be used to check out dependencies and maintain Git submodule state as well.

### Swift Package Manager

Add us to your `Package.swift`:

```
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "My Nerdy App",
    dependencies: [
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/bignerdranch/Freddy.git", majorVersion: 2),
    ]
)
```

### iOS 7

If you would like to use Freddy with iOS 7, then you will need to copy Freddy's source files into your project.
Embedded frameworks are only supported in iOS 8+.
You can add Freddy as a submodule (see above), and then make sure to add the source files to your project.

## Setting Breakpoint Errors

It can be helpful to set breakpoints for errors when you start working with a new set of JSON.
This allows you to explore the structure of the JSON when you break.
In particular, you will likely want to set a breakpoint for `Freddy`'s `JSON.Error` so that you can inspect what went wrong.

Here is how you can set this sort of breakpoint:

1) Go to the Breakpoint navigator

2) Click the "+" button in the bottom left corner

![Breakpoint navigator](https://github.com/bignerdranch/Freddy/raw/master/README_Images/projectNav_addBreakpoint.png)

3) Select "Add Swift Error Breakpoint"

![Add Error Breakpoint](https://github.com/bignerdranch/Freddy/raw/master/README_Images/addErrorBreakpoint.png)

Now you have a breakpoint that will only trigger when a Swift error is generated.
But your program will break whenever *any* Swift error is thrown.
What if you only want to break for `Freddy`'s `JSON.Error` error?

You can edit the breakpoint to add a filter:

1) Right-click your new error breakpoint

2) Select Edit Breakpoint...

![Edit Breakpoint](https://github.com/bignerdranch/Freddy/raw/master/README_Images/editBreakpoint.png)

3) A window will appear with a text box for "Type"

4) Enter `JSON.Error`

![Error Type](https://github.com/bignerdranch/Freddy/raw/master/README_Images/addType.png)

And that is pretty much it! You now have an error breakpoint that will only trigger when errors of type `JSON.Error` are thrown.
Take a look at the framework's tests for further examples of usage.
The Wiki also have a lot of very useful information.
